# TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset Analysis


## Introduction

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
- Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
- There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
- The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.


## Objectives:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format that can be used
- Communicating the results of your analysis
